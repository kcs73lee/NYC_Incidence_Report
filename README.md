In this report, we’ll being analyzing the NYC Shooting Incidence data. We’ll begin with tidying up and
transforming our data, then visualizing it and doing some analysis, and finally we’ll discuss potential biases
from the analysis and summarize our findings. The question we will address in this analysis is: what can we
infer about the relationship between the number of incidents and the time and place?
